# Zero-shot Improvement of Object Counting with CLIP
This is the code repository for paper **Zero-shot Improvement of Object Counting with CLIP** ([link](link))


## Image object counting demo
Ask Stable Diffusion to generate an image of certain number of objects. 
Note that this method works more effective with count no larger than 5.

Ask CLIP the 

## Reproduce experiment results

evaluate CLIP on the custom dataset

image classification accuracy on my own dataset

image classification accurayc on countbench
choose between "custom","countbench"

image retrievel on the custom dataset

examples of stable diffusion 
"classification","image_retrievel","image_gen"
